# Hi, I'm Nqobile 👋

I'm a **self-taught fullstack developer** with a unique journey from healthcare to tech. My background in Speech-Language Pathology taught me the power of communication, problem-solving, and empathy which are skills I now channel into building meaningful digital experiences.

# My Journey to Tech

In 2024, I stumbled upon a coding video by chance, and something clicked. I was captivated by the idea of solving real-world problems through technology. What started as curiosity quickly became a passion.

While still working in healthcare, I dove headfirst into learning JavaScript, React, Node.js, and everything in between. I'd finish my shifts at the hospital and immediately switch gears to coding where I was building projects, debugging errors at 2 AM, and gradually watching my skills transform.

Fast forward to today: I've built fullstack applications, tackled complex challenges, and discovered that I genuinely love this craft. I'm now fully committed to growing as a software engineer and contributing to impactful projects.

# What Drives Me

- **Problem-solving**: I thrive on breaking down complex challenges into elegant solutions. Whether it's optimising a database query or designing an intuitive user interface, I love finding the "aha!" moment.

- **Continuous learning**: The tech landscape is always evolving, and I'm here for it. From mastering new frameworks to diving into AI integrations, I embrace the constant growth this field demands.

- **Building with purpose**: I want to create tools and experiences that make people's lives better. Technology should be accessible, intuitive, and genuinely helpful.

# My Approach to Development

I believe great software comes from understanding both the technical and human sides of a problem. My healthcare background taught me to listen, empathise, and communicate clearly which are skills that translate surprisingly well into collaborating with teams, understanding user needs, and writing maintainable code.

I'm particularly passionate about:
- **Fullstack development** (MERN stack is my playground)
- **Real-time applications** (there's something magical about instant connections)
- **Clean, scalable code** (future me will thank present me)
- **User-centered design** (if it's not intuitive, it's not done)

# Beyond Code

When I'm not coding, you'll find me:
- **Running** – My favorite way to clear my head and think through complex problems.
- **Eating sushi** – Obsessed, honestly. It's a problem.
- **Playing with numbers** – I have this quirky habit of seeing letters as numbers and adding them up (yes, even on license plates).
- **Dreaming up side projects** – Like designing loungewear specifically for remote workers. One day!

# Fun Facts

- I can't pinpoint every country on a map (but I'm working on it!).
- I strongly dislike coffee ☕️ (yes, I'm that developer).
- Summer is my season – give me warmth and sunshine any day.
- White hot chocolate > regular hot chocolate (fight me).
- I secretly hope I'm not over-sharing as I write this page.

# What I'm Looking For

I'm excited to join a team where I can:
- Contribute to meaningful projects that solve real problems.
- Continue learning from experienced developers.
- Collaborate with people who value creativity and curiosity.
- Build software that makes a difference.
