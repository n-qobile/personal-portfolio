# Intro

Hi, I'm Nqobile, a healthcare professional turned full-stack developer with a passion for problem-solving and improving user experiences. My experience in healthcare honed my problem-solving skills, attention to detail, and empathy—qualities I now apply to building meaningful digital solutions.

# Some History

- <strong>Graduated from University</strong>
  I graduated with a degree in Speech-Language Pathology and began my professional journey in healthcare. I was excited to start making a difference in people's lives.

- <strong>Worked as a Healthcare Worker</strong>
  After graduation, I went into my community service year where I worked in the hospital, helping patients improve their communication skills and providing essential therapy.

- <strong>Realized Healthcare Wasn’t My True Passion</strong>
  While I loved helping others, I started to feel that my true interests lay elsewhere. I wanted to create lasting change and impact in a different way.

- <strong>Discovered Coding by Chance</strong>
  One day, I stumbled upon a video about coding. I was captivated by the idea of solving problems through technology, and instantly felt a spark of passion.

- <strong>Started Learning to Code in 2024</strong>
  In early 2024, I made the decision to transition into tech. I began self-learning JavaScript, HTML, CSS, React and many more, diving deep into the world of development and discovering how much I enjoyed it while still working as a healthcare professional.

- <strong>Grew My Skills Through Projects</strong>
  Since then, I’ve worked on various projects, from building simple apps to diving into full-stack development, with the goal of building practical solutions and learning as much as possible.

- <strong>Now Here, Aspiring Developer</strong>
  I’m now focused on building my career as a software developer, with a passion for problem-solving, learning new technologies, and making a meaningful impact in the tech world.
